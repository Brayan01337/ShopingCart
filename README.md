## How the app works

The app uses a loop to collect items. It asks for three things per item:

1. Item name
2. Unit price
3. Quantity

It validates input for price and quantity. It computes the line total as price Ã— quantity. It adds line totals to a subtotal. It applies tax (a simple constant or user-set rate). It prints a receipt that lists each line, subtotal, tax, and total.

Flow example (user input shown after >):

Enter item name (or type done to finish):
> Apple
Enter price for Apple:
> 0.80
Enter quantity for Apple:
> 3
Add another item? (yes/no)
> yes
Enter item name (or type done to finish):
> Milk
Enter price for Milk:
> 1.50
Enter quantity for Milk:
> 2
Add another item? (yes/no)
> no

Receipt:
- Apple x3 @ 0.80 = 2.40
- Milk x2 @ 1.50 = 3.00
Subtotal: 5.40
Tax (8%): 0.43
Total: 5.83

The app prints numbers with two decimal places for currency.

## Example usage (detailed)

1. Start the app.
2. At prompt, type the product name.
3. At price prompt, type a numeric value. Use dot for decimal.
4. At quantity prompt, type an integer.
5. Repeat until you type "done" or select finish.
6. The app prints a receipt and asks to confirm purchase.
7. Confirm to finalize and exit.

The app accepts common input mistakes. If you type a non-numeric price, it asks again. If you type a negative quantity, it rejects it.

## Configuration

- Tax rate: change the tax constant in the source to reflect your local rate.
- Currency format: the app prints two decimal places. Modify formatting in code to change style.
- Input validation: tweak limits and messages in the input handler.

Files to inspect

- src/Main.java â€” entry point and main loop
- src/Cart.java â€” data structure for items and totals
- src/Utils.java â€” helper functions (input parsing, formatting)

---

## Development notes

- The project uses core Java only. It relies on java.util and java.io packages.
- The code uses Scanner for input.
- Use BigDecimal for high-precision currency math if you expand the app for production.
- Keep numeric types simple for learning. Use double for basic practice.
